# Twitter Clone App Backend

## Overview

This is the backend for a Twitter clone application, designed to facilitate the creation, management, and interaction with tweets. Users can create accounts, log in and out, and perform actions like creating, deleting, and viewing tweets. The backend is built using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, providing a robust and scalable environment for handling user data and tweets.

## Features

- **User Authentication**
  - **Create Account**: Users can register by providing their credentials. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/user/register
  - **Login**: Users can authenticate to access their accounts. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/user/login
  - **Logout**: Users can securely log out of their accounts. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/user/logout

- **Tweet Management**
  - **Create a Tweet**: Authenticated users can create new tweets. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/tweet/create
  - **Delete a Tweet**: Users can delete their own tweets. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/tweet/delete/:id
  - **View All Tweets**: Users can view all tweets posted by themselves and others. API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/tweet/alltweets

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware management.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and tweet data.

## Challenges

Creating a Twitter clone backend involves several challenges, including:

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to ensure user data protection.
2. **Database Design**: Structuring the MongoDB database to efficiently handle user accounts and tweets, including relationships between users and their tweets.
3. **Scalability**: Designing the application to handle an increasing number of users and tweets without performance degradation.
4. **Data Validation**: Ensuring that user input is validated and sanitized to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL Injection.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implementing measures to prevent abuse of the tweet creation and deletion features.
6. **Testing**: Creating comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and update the connection string in the configuration file.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
